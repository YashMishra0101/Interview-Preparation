## 📝 Important Note: Better Comments for VS Code

I’m using the **Better Comments** VS Code extension to highlight important notes, questions, concepts, answers, and other stuff with different colors. This makes it easier to identify key points while coding.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is **not necessary**. If you use it, you’ll get a more **visually enhanced experience** with colored highlights. Otherwise, all notes, concepts, questions, answers, and other stuff will appear in **normal text form**. This extension is purely optional and intended to improve readability and organization while coding. It doesn’t affect functionality in any way.

**Installation:**

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to **Extensions** (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
3. Search for **Better Comments** and install it.

**Use this setting (optional but recommended):**

```json
"better-comments.tags": [
  {
    "tag": "#",
    "color": "red",
    "strikethrough": false,
    "underline": false,
    "backgroundColor": "transparent",
    "bold": true,
    "italic": false
  },
  {
    "tag": "--",
    "color": "green",
    "strikethrough": false,
    "underline": false,
    "backgroundColor": "transparent",
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false
  },
  {
    "tag": "?",
    "color": "white",
    "strikethrough": false,
    "underline": false,
    "backgroundColor": "transparent",
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false
  },
  {
    "tag": ">",
    "color": "yellow",
    "strikethrough": false,
    "underline": false,
    "backgroundColor": "transparent",
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false
  }
]
```

💡 **Tip:** You can customize these colors and tags based on your preferences. The main goal is to make your **all notes, concepts, questions, answers, and other stuff** more **visible and structured**, especially when working on large projects or revising your code.

This setup helps me quickly identify **important notes, tasks, or reminders** without getting lost in the code. Again, it’s **completely optional**, but it can make your coding workflow a lot smoother and more organized.
