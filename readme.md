# Welcome to the Frontend Interview Preparation Repository 🧑‍💻

Here, you'll find a curated list of **questions with answers**, **concepts**, and **practice sections** to help you prepare effectively for frontend interviews. Whether you're just starting or brushing up, this repository has something for everyone 💪.

## **Why This Repository?**

This repository covers the most commonly asked interview questions and concepts for entry-level and fresher jobs.

Unlike other repositories, this one is not designed to include everything in the name of interview prep. Instead, it focuses on what’s truly important for interviews, providing key questions and concepts directly to help you prepare effectively.

This repository includes:

- 🌐 **HTML**
- 🎨 **CSS**
- ⚙️ **JavaScript**
- ⚛️ **React**
- 🧩 **Machine Coding** (For React-Based Interviews)
- 🔷 **TypeScript**
- Basic Backend Questions
- General HR Question 

## 📂 Folder and File Naming Conventions (Which I Used)

- **Folders**: Use **kebab-case** (e.g., `frontend-basics`, `react-hooks`).
- **Files**: Use **PascalCase** (e.g., `InterviewQuestions.md`, `PracticeCode.js`).

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each section contains:

1. **Interview Questions**: A comprehensive list of questions with detailed answers to strengthen your preparation.
2. **Practice Section**: A dedicated space to practice related concepts and code hands-on.
   - 📝 _Note_: The pre-existing code reflects my personal practice. Feel free to modify it, break it, and rebuild it—your repo, your rules 😎
3. **Concepts**: Proper explanations of important concepts, making even complex topics easier to understand.

Note : You may find some grammatical or spelling mistakes. But hey, coding is more important, right? 😜 So, ignore those slip-ups and focus on what truly matters—your code.
