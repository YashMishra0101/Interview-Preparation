# Welcome to the Frontend Interview Preparation Repository 🧑‍💻

Here, you'll find a curated list of **questions with answers**, **concepts**, and **practice sections** to help you prepare effectively for frontend interviews. Whether you're just starting or brushing up, this repository has something for everyone.

## 🚧 Important Note: A Work in Progress (WIP)

**Please Note:** This repository is currently under active development as I am in the midst of my own interview preparation. The current structure and contents reflect my ongoing learning journey.

My primary focus right now is on studying and practicing. **Please don't mistake the current state for a finished or perfectly organized resource.** You may find incomplete sections, drafts, or rough notes—please don’t expect it to be fully ready yet. Once my preparation is complete, I will dedicate time to properly structuring, refining, and organizing all the content into a more polished and comprehensive guide.

This repository serves as a living document of my current study progress 🧑‍💻.

## Why This Repository?

This repository covers the most commonly asked interview questions and concepts for entry-level and fresher jobs.

Unlike other repositories, this one is not designed to include everything in the name of interview prep. Instead, it focuses on what’s truly important for interviews, providing key questions and concepts directly to help you prepare effectively.

This repository includes:

🌐 HTML

🎨 CSS

⚙️ JavaScript

⚛️ React

🧩 Machine Coding (for React-based interviews)

🔷 TypeScript

✅ Projects built using JavaScript, React, and TypeScript to revise and reinforce core concepts

🛠️ Basic Backend Questions

💬 General HR Questions (to prepare for interview rounds)

## 📂 Folder and File Naming Conventions (Which I Used)

- **Folders**: Use **kebab-case** (e.g., `frontend-basics`, `react-hooks`).
- **Files**: Use **PascalCase** (e.g., `InterviewQuestions.md`, `PracticeCode.js`).

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each section contains:

1. Interview Questions: A comprehensive list of questions with detailed answers to strengthen your preparation.
2. **Concepts**: Proper explanations of important concepts, making even complex topics easier to understand.
3. **Practice Section**: A dedicated space to practice related concepts and code hands-on.
   - 📝 _Note_: The pre-existing code reflects my personal practice. Feel free to modify it, break it, and rebuild it—your repo, your rules 😎

## Note 🤚

You may find some grammatical or spelling mistakes. But hey, coding is more important, right? 😜 So, ignore those slip-ups and focus on what truly matters—your code.
