# 1) How To add css in hmtl ?

There are three main ways** to add CSS to HTML:

1. **Inline CSS** 
   - CSS styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
   - Useful for applying quick, one-time styles to specific elements but not ideal for large-scale styling.
   ```html
   <h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Hello World</h1>
   ```

2. **Internal CSS**  
   - CSS rules are placed inside a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
   - Useful for styling a single page without needing an external stylesheet.
   ```html
   <head>
       <style>
           h1 {
               color: blue;
               font-size: 24px;
           }
       </style>
   </head>
   ```

3. **External CSS**  
   - CSS rules are stored in a separate `.css` file, which is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag inside the `<head>`.
   - Best for larger projects, as it separates design and content, making the CSS reusable across multiple pages.
   ```html
   <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   ```

### Summary:

- **Inline CSS**: Quick, one-time styling on individual elements.
- **Internal CSS**: Applies to the entire page, defined within `<style>` in `<head>`.
- **External CSS**: Best practice for large projects, allows styles to be applied across multiple pages. 

Using **external CSS** is the preferred choice for most cases due to better maintainability and reusability.

# 2)What is CSS preprocessor ?

A *CSS preprocessor* is a tool that expands standard CSS capabilities, letting developers write code that is 
more dynamic, organized, and efficient. With preprocessors like **Sass**, **Less**, and **Stylus**, you can 
use features such as:

- Variables: Store reusable values like colors and fonts.
- Nesting: Write CSS in a way that visually mirrors the HTML structure.
- Mathematical Operations: Perform calculations, useful in responsive design.
- Mixins and Functions: Reuse code blocks for common styles, reducing redundancy.

*Sass* (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is one of the most widely used preprocessors, enabling features 
like variables, selector nesting, and more complex operations, making it a popular choice for writing 
organized, maintainable CSS. Preprocessor code compiles into standard CSS, ready for the browser.

# 3)What is border size border box ?

When you use `box-sizing: border-box` in CSS, adding padding or borders **won‚Äôt change the actual height and 
width** of an element. The total size remains as you set it (e.g., 500px height and 500px width).  

Without `box-sizing: border-box` padding and borders **will increase** 
the total height and width, making the element larger than what you initially set.  

By default, `box-sizing` is set to `content-box`.

--box-sizing:border-box;
--box-sizing:content-box;(By default)

# 4)About Margin collapsing ?

In simple words, margin collapsing is a behavior in CSS where the vertical margins of two elements "combine" or 
"merge" into one margin instead of adding up. This happens with block-level elements (like div, p, etc.) and 
only for vertical margins (top and bottom), not horizontal margins.

--When Does Margin Collapsing Happen? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. Adjacent Elements (Sibling Elements) 
   Margins of two sibling elements that touch each other vertically will collapse.  
   - Example:  
     
     <div class="box1"></div>
     <div class="box2"></div>

     If `.box1` has `margin-bottom: 20px` and `.box2` has `margin-top: 30px`, only **30px** margin will be applied 
     between them.

2. Parent and First/Last Child 
   Margins of a parent element and its **first** or **last child** can collapse if there's no padding, border, 
   or content between them.

   - Example:  

     <div class="parent">
         <div class="child"></div>
     </div>
    
     If `.child` has `margin-top: 20px`, it might push the `.parent` down, as the margins collapse.

3. Empty Elements*
   If a block-level element has no content, no padding, and no border, its top and bottom margins may 
   collapse into one.

-- Why Does CSS Do This? üòÖ  

Margin collapsing is a CSS feature designed to avoid unnecessary extra space between elements. 
It simplifies layout rendering by not stacking up margins.


-- Key Points to Remember:

1. Margin collapsing only happens for **vertical margins** (top and bottom) and for block level element.  
2. The **larger margin** wins, and the smaller one disappears.  
3. Horizontal margins never collapse.


-- Example to Visualize:

<style>
  .box1 {
    background: lightblue;
    height: 50px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
  .box2 {
    background: lightgreen;
    height: 50px;
    margin-top: 30px;
  }
</style>

<div class="box1"></div>
<div class="box2"></div>

What happens ?
- Instead of 50px (20px + 30px) spacing between the boxes, you‚Äôll only see 30px.


>Solutions to Margin Collapsing

1. **Add Padding**  
   - Add padding to the parent element or the child element.  
   - Padding creates a "buffer" that prevents margins from collapsing.  
   ```css
   .parent {
       padding-top: 10px; Prevents collapsing 
      }

   
   2. **Add Borders**  
      - Even a transparent border will stop the collapse.  
      ```css
      .parent {
          border: 1px solid transparent; Stops margin collapsing 
      }

   
   3. **Use Overflow Property**  
      - Set `overflow` to `hidden`, `auto`, or `scroll` on the parent element to contain the child margins.  
      ```css
      .parent {
          overflow: hidden; Stops margin collapse 
      }

   
   4. **Use Display Properties**  
      - Change the display type of the parent to `inline-block`, `flex`, or `grid`.  
      - These properties naturally prevent margin collapsing.  
      ```css
      .parent {
          display: flex;  Flexbox stops collapsing 
      }
  
   Summary:  
   The most common and practical methods are **padding** and **overflow: hidden**. These are widely used in the 
   industry to handle collapsing margins effectively. Keep it clean and efficient.

# 5)Position Property In CSS ?

  position: static (Default);
  position: relative;
  position: absolute;
  position: fixed;
  position: sticky;
  
There are Four Main Postion Property :

1. `static` (Default):  
   - This is the default position for elements.  

2. `relative`:  
   - You can move it using properties like top, right, bottom, or left.

3. `absolute`:  
   - The element moves based on its nearest parent with a position set (like `relative`)**.  
   - If there‚Äôs no such parent, it moves based on the whole page (`body`). 
   - absolute relies on a relative parent; otherwise, it uses the body.
 
5. `sticky`:  
   - You have to give something like "top:0px" working it , if you just write postion:sticky so it will no work.
   - The element sticks in place while you scroll within it's nearest parent container.  
   - It "sticks" to a specified offset (e.g., top: 0) within its nearest parent container and stops sticking once it reaches the parent's boundary.
   
4. `fixed`:  
   - The element stays in a fixed spot on the screen, no matter how much you scroll.  
   - If top, bottom, left, or right are used, the element is positioned relative to the 
   direct viewport(browser window/body) not to nearest parent , no realtive like thing is 
   working her like with absolute. 
   
   --Key Differences Between Fixed and Sticky :

| Property         | `fixed`                            | `sticky`                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Reference        | Viewport                          | Parent container boundaries         |
| Scroll Behavior  | Always stays fixed                | Becomes fixed within a boundary     |
| Common Use       | Navigation bars, floating buttons | Table headers, sticky sections      |

# 6)What is Pseudo Elements ?

With the help of pseudo-elements, we can use CSS to style specific parts of an element or add extra 
content without modifying the HTML or using JavaScript.

--syntax : 

selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}

Some Examples of Pseudo-elements 

1. `::first-letter`**: Styles the first letter of a block of text.  
2. `::selection`**: Styles the part of text selected by the user.  
3. `::before`**: Adds content before an element's content.  
4. `::after`**: Adds content after an element's content.  
5. `::marker`**: is used to style the markers of list items in ordered (<ol>) or unordered (<ul>) 
lists, such as bullets or numbers.

# 7)Tell me what is colors codes and how to use them (How to give colors in css)?

>1. Named Colors :

Normal colors names , CSS supports 140 predefined color names, such as:  
- `red`  
- `blue`  
- `green`  
- `black`  
- `white` 

--Example:  

color: red;


>2)RGB (red,blue,green)

In CSS colors are primarily defined using the RGB color model, which stands for Red, Green, and Blue. These three 
primary colors combine in various intensities (from 0 to 255) to create a wide range of colors for use in digital 
designs.

CSS uses RGB because it's suited for screens, which display colors by emitting light. By adjusting the intensity 
of each color channel (R, G, B), you can form millions of colors, making RGB perfect for digital environments.

-- Syntax:

rgba(red, green, blue)

--Examples :

rgb(255, 0, 0): Pure red (maximum red, no green or blue).
rgb(0, 255, 0): Pure green.
rgb(0, 0, 255): Pure blue.
rgb(255, 255, 255): White (all colors at full intensity).
rgb(0, 0, 0): Black (no light emitted from any channel).


>3)RGBA (red,blue,green,alpha)

RGBA in CSS is an extension of the **RGB color model**. It adds an **alpha channel** to specify the color's 
**opacity** (transparency). While **RGB** focuses solely on the intensity of red, green, and blue, **RGBA** 
lets you control how transparent  color is.

-- Syntax:

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

--Examples :

background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);  A semi-transparent red 


- `red`, `green`, and `blue`: These define the intensity of the primary colors, ranging from **0 to 255**.
- `alpha`: Defines the transparency level, ranging from **0 (completely transparent)** to **1 (completely opaque)**.



> 4). Hexadecimal (Hex) Codes

Hex codes are 6-character values representing the intensities of red, green, and blue (RGB) in a color
and they start with a hashtag (#).

Hexadecimal codes are a way to define colors in CSS. These codes use a combination of numbers (0‚Äì9) and letters (A‚ÄìF) to 
represent the intensity of the red, green, and blue (RGB) components of a color. A hexadecimal code consists of 6 characters 
grouped into three pairs: the first two represent red, the next two represent green, and the last two represent blue. 
You can use only numbers, only letters, or a mix of both in these pairs.

-- Examples:  

  - `#FF0000` ‚Üí Red  
  - `#00FF00` ‚Üí Green  
  - `#0000FF` ‚Üí Blue  
  - `#000` ‚Üí Black (short form)  
  - #05abcd
  - #cdabcd
  - #FF5733
  - #000000

>5. HSL Colors (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)

HSL specifies colors based on hue (0-360¬∞), saturation (0-100%), and lightness (0-100%).  
 
--Syntax

hsl(hue(colors), saturation, lightness);

-- Example:  

color: hsl(30, 100%, 50%);  A shade of orange 
color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);  Bright blue 
color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);    Bright red 
color: hsl(90, 100%, 50%);

>6. HSLA Colors (with Transparency)

HSLA adds an **alpha** channel for transparency, just like `rgba()`.  
- Format: `hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)`

-- Example:  

color: hsla(30, 100%, 50%, 0.5);  50% transparent orange 


>7. CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
Colors can be defined as variables for reuse.  

-- Example:  

:root {
  --main-color: #FF5733;
}
p {
  color: var(--main-color);
}


# 8) What is CSS combinator ?

Note ü§ö: Just read it for knowledge purposes and watch a quick video on YouTube for a better understanding. No one is asking for a detailed explanation of what a CSS combinator is; just read it and watch one video on YouTube. That‚Äôs it.
CSS combinators define the relationship between elements in HTML to style them based on their connection. 
There are four main types:

1. **Descendant (`space`)**: Targets all elements inside another element.  
   Example: `div p` (styles all `<p>` inside a `<div>`).

2. **Child (`>`)**: Targets only direct children.  
   Example: `div > p` (styles only direct `<p>` children of a `<div>`).

3. **Adjacent Sibling (`+`)**: Targets the next immediate sibling.  
   Example: `h1 + p` (styles the first `<p>` right after an `<h1>`).

4. **General Sibling (`~`)**: Targets all siblings after a specific element.  
   Example: `h1 ~ p` (styles all `<p>` after an `<h1>`).


# 9)Box shadow

--Syntax :

box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color;

Examples :

Simple : box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px gray;
Spread Effect : box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
Inset Shadow (Adds a shadow inside the element. Use the inset keyword.) : box-shadow: inset 5px 5px 10px black;

>ü§ö In general, "pseudo" means false, fake, or pretend. In CSS, pseudo-classes (:) and pseudo-elements (::) are not in the HTML. They are written in the CSS file and act like virtual parts or states, which is why they are called pseudo. 

# 10) What is css variable and how to use them ?

 CSS variables (also called custom properties) are a way to store reusable values in CSS, making your code more efficient and 
 easier to maintain. They are particularly useful when you want to define values like colors, fonts, or spacing that you might
 use in multiple places.

 CSS variables allow you to declare a value once and use it throughout your CSS. They are defined 
 using -- followed by a name (e.g., --main-color).

--Syntax

Defining a variable: Use the --variable-name syntax inside a :root or a selector.

:root {
    --main-color: #3498db;
    --font-size: 16px;
}

:root is a pseudo-class that represents the document's root element. Variables defined here are global.

--useCases 

h1 {
   color: var(--main-color);
   font-size: var(--font-size);
}
   
Why Use CSS Variables?

Reusability: Change a value in one place, and it updates everywhere.
Maintainability: Your CSS is easier to read and modify.
Theming: Easily implement themes by switching variable values.

# 11) Tell me which is the better approach in developemt and Why ?
*{
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*,*::before,::after{
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

Ans :  You should use the **second approach** because:  

1. It applies styles to both elements and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`), ensuring consistency across all parts of your design.  
2. Pseudo-elements sometimes have default styles in browsers that can cause unexpected layout issues. The second approach resets those styles too.  
3. It‚Äôs the **standard practice** used by industry experts and frameworks, making your code more professional and future-proof.  

In short: The **second approach** avoids hidden bugs caused by pseudo-elements and ensures your layout is consistent everywhere.

# 12) Image (img) is a inline element so why we can able to set widht and height of <img> tag ?

The `<img>` tag is an **inline element**, but since it contains **external content (the image)**, 
the browser allows us to set its `height` and `width`. This is because the `<img>` tag is specifically 
designed to handle images, making it a **special inline element** that supports dimensions for proper display.

# 13) Float and Clear 
--Before flex box and grid we was using Float and Clear 
Float:
The float property is used to position elements to the left or right within their container, allowing text or 
other elements to wrap around them.

Clear:
The clear property is used to stop elements from wrapping around floated elements. It ensures the element starts
below the floated elements.

Clear in simple language:
When you use float on an element (like an image), other elements (like text) can move around it. The clear 
property tells the browser:
"Stop wrapping content around the floated element and start below it."

# 14)About flex box.

--Quick Revision About flex box.

In simple language, flexbox helps you design layouts and arrange items within a container according to our
needs and it also helps us to creating reponsive design.

> justify-content: justify-content helps aligns flex items along the x axis (Horizontally/row by default) or y axis vertical if `flex-direction` is column.
> align-items: align-items helps aligns flex items along the y-axis (vertical/colum by default) or x-axis horizontal if flex-direction is set to row.
> space-between: The space is only between the items no space on the edges (left and right).
> space-around: Equal space around items, but on edges (left and right) spaces are smaller.  
> space-evenly: Equal space everywhere ‚Äîbetween items and at the edges.  
> basline: When you use align-items: baseline, it aligns the text of all items so that their baseline (the line where text sits) is aligned horizontally.
> align-self: The align-self property specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container.
> align-content in CSS is used to control the spacing between multiple rows of items in a flex container. It works only when the container has multiple rows (using flex-wrap: wrap).
   --Works only: When the flex container has multiple lines (enabled by flex-wrap: wrap or wrap-reverse),Does not affect ,Single-line flex containers.
>Note ü§ö: 
If flex-wrap is not set to wrap (or is set to its default value, nowrap), the align-content property will not work, 
even if the container has more than one line of content.
This is because align-content only applies when the flex container allows items to wrap into multiple rows or 
columns.

1. `flex-direction:`  
   - `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse`.

2. `justify-content:`  
   - `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-around`, `space-between`, `space-evenly`.

3. `align-items:`  
   - `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`(this is default), `baseline`.

4. `align-content:`  
   - `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `stretch (this is default)`.

5. `gap` / `row-gap` / `column-gap:`  
   - examples: `10px`, `1rem`, `5%`.

6. `align-self (for child):`  
   - `auto`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, `stretch`.

7. `order (for child):`  
   - Numeric values to define item order. Default: `0`.  
   - We can change the order of the items.

8. `flex-grow (for child):`  
   - Specifies how much space an item should take relative to others. Default is `0`.

9. `flex-shrink (for child):`  
   - Specifies how much an item should shrink when space is limited. Default is `1`. 

10. flex-basic ( for child );
   - we can set the width of flex item width 
 >Note (V.V IMP)
 =>
- If you use `width`: It will **set a fixed width** for the item, and `flex-grow` or `flex-shrink`
won‚Äôt affect it. The item will stay at that width.

- If you use `flex-basis`: It will set the initial size for the item, and `flex-grow` and 
`flex-shrink` will work based on that starting size. The item can grow or shrink depending on
 available space in the container.

# 14)About Grid.

VIDEO_LINK : https://youtu.be/EiNiSFIPIQE?si=64u3vOQwbkieHFux  ( ü§ö First Watch this Video )

--About Parent :

grid-template-rows : 1rem 1rem 1rem   or  1fr 1fr 1fr  or  repeat(3, 1fr) or repeat (3,minmax(2rem,1fr)) or  repeat(auto-fit,minmax(2rem,1fr))
grid-template-rows : 1rem 1rem 1rem   or  1fr 1fr 1fr  or  repeat(3, 1fr) or repeat (3,minmax(2rem,1fr)) or  repeat(auto-fit,minmax(2rem,1fr))

# 18) The most awaited question: How to center a div üòÇ üòÇ ? 

1. Using Flexbox (Recommended for modern browsers)
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh;">
    <div>Centered Content</div>
</div>

2. Using Grid (Alternative method)
<div style="display: grid; place-items: center; height: 100vh;">
    <div>Centered Content</div>
</div>

3. Using Margin Auto (for horizontal centering)
<div style="width: 200px; margin: 0 auto;">
    Centered Content
</div>

4. Using Absolute Positioning
<div style="position: relative; height: 100vh;">
    <div style="position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">
        Centered Content
    </div>
</div>

>>In a real-world scenario, Flexbox or Grid is generally preferred because of their simplicity and flexibility.
