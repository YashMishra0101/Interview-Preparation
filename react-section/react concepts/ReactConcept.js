#1)What is useSate in React ?

With the help of the useState hook, we can manage state in React functional components. For example, 
in the code const [initialValue, updateValue] = useState(1);, we define two items inside the array: 
the first is initialValue, and the second is updateValue. The initialValue starts with the value you
pass to useState (like 1 in this example). The updateValue is a function used to update the initialValue. 
This is how the useState hook works.
